# Cleaned-Fox

The Cleaned-Fox Browser is a web browser designed with privacy, simplicity, and performance in mind. It's built on Mullvad's source code (which is based on Tor), offering a clean and private browsing experience. Since Mullvad/Tor browser are too hardened, our goal is to find a balance by slightly reducing some of the hardening to improve speed without sacrificing privacy.
